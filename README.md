# Hawkeye juggling video analysis
Hawkeye is a Python/Qt application to analyze and view videos containing juggling.

The application uses the OpenCV computer vision library to identify and track balls moving in parabolic trajectories, displaying the information as an overlay on top of a video viewer. Hawkeye's video viewer supports smooth stepping forward/backward by single frames, as well as zooming, to allow you to see details well.

The goal of Hawkeye is to help jugglers understand their form and improve their skills by allowing them to view practice video easily and efficiently.
